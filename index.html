<p>Having worked as a GIS Consultant and web developer in various projects and companies, I have collected a selection of code samples and libraries that help to develop new tools. Currently working in a software company as a Solutions Consultant, I try to find a number of ways to provide solutions to our clients in any way possible.</p>

<p>Please browse the available repositories or forks, and would love to hear of any improvements or questions people may have.</p>
