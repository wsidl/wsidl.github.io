### Bio

Having worked as a GIS Consultant and web developer in various projects and companies, I have collected a selection of code samples and libraries that help to develop new tools. Currently working in a software company as a Solutions Consultant, I try to find a number of ways to provide solutions to our clients in any way possible.</p>

Please browse the available repositories or forks, and would love to hear of any improvements or questions people may have.</p>

### List of Repositories

Through a number of projects and questions, I've developed some libraries to help speed things along.

#### Javascript/jQuery

- [jquery-translate](https://github.com/wsidl/jQuery-translate): jQuery plugin for handling multiple languages within a website. Handles complex features and formats while still being lightweight.

#### Python

- Nothing here yet. Still organizing them.

#### Projects

- [avadepth](https://github.com/pwgsc/avadepth): Website for the querying and distribution of hydrographic and bathymetry data for the Canadian Coast Guard.
